While my website is viewable for over 95% of browser users, there are a few instances where an outdated browser cannot view due to not supprting web assembly. Here is a link to the site that provides whether a user's browser supports wasm, and potential fixes for some of the browser versions: https://caniuse.com/wasm.

I know my website probably isn't perfect, or the prettiest. So if you have a request or found an issue, feel free to shoot me an email at hunterpage27171@gmail.com. I'll do my best to address the issues in a timely manner.
